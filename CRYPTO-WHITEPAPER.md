## Abstract
BitChat is a peer-to-peer messaging platform that forms an *opportunistic mesh* over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi Direct.  
This paper proposes **Relay-Token (RLT)**—a lightweight cryptocurrency that:

* Prices every message (and file) hop with a micro-payment. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**  
* Rewards relay nodes instantly and offline. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**  
* Enables fee-based route selection (fast/expensive vs. slow/cheap). ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**  
* Anchors security to public blockchains only when connectivity is available. ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

The design combines a *DAG-style feeless ledger* with local proofs, enabling trust-minimised payments on resource-constrained mobile hardware.

---

## Background & Motivation
1. **Resilience without infrastructure** – Pure mesh networks suffer from *tragedy of the commons*: users benefit from relays but bear no cost to host them.  
2. **Incentive alignment** – A native token can reward devices for forwarding traffic, encouraging denser coverage and longer uptime.  
3. **Spam resistance** – Pricing by hop naturally throttles flood attacks and large file transfers.  
4. **User choice** – Attaching a budget lets senders choose between latency and cost, similar to gas pricing in traditional blockchains.

## System Overview
| Component | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Packet Layer** | Extends current `BitchatPacket` with *fee* and *txHash* fields. | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Local Ledger (DAG)** | Each message is itself a transaction that approves two prior transactions, forming a directed acyclic graph. | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Relay-Token (RLT)** | Inflationary utility token minted per hop; divisible to `10-6` (µRLT). | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Anchors** | Periodic Merkle roots pushed to public chains (Bitcoin, Polygon) or Nostr relays for global consensus. | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Fee Beacons** | Relays advertise a `relayMinFee` in discovery payloads; senders compute total cost before dispatch. | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |

---

## Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Packet Extension ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
```swift
struct BitChatHeaderV2 {
    uint8 version = 0x02;
    uint8 ttl; // decremented each hop
    uint32 fee_per_hop; // µRLT
    uint256 tx_hash; // SHA-256 of RelayTx
    /* existing fields … */
}
```

### 4.2 Relay Transaction (RelayTx) ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
```swift
message RelayTx {
    bytes id = sha256(this); // 32 bytes
    bytes parents[2]; // tips approved
    uint32 fee_per_hop; // µRLT
    bytes sender_pub; // 32 bytes (Ed25519)
    bytes signature; // 64 bytes
}
```

*Size impact per hop ≈ 100 bytes (<< BLE MTU 251).*

### 4.3 Ledger Storage ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
* ✅ SQLite on-device (`DAGStorage.swift`)  
* ✅ Pruning rule: keep only ancestors ≤ `depth_window` (default = 1 000 tx)  
* ❌ Snapshot export/import over Wi-Fi Direct for rapid sync

### 4.4 Anchoring Protocol ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
1. Device computes Merkle root of current DAG tip-set.  
2. Posts root to a selected *anchor network* when any internet link appears.  
3. Peers accept longest-anchored sub-DAG during conflict resolution.

## Token Economics

| Parameter | Value (initial) | Notes | Status |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| **Inflation** | 1 RLT minted *per hop* | Uncapped supply; value derives from utility. | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Relay reward** | 100 % of hop fee | Paid instantly, spendable once anchored. | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Base fee (µRLT)** | Adaptive EMA of last 1 000 hops | Broadcast via fee beacons. | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Spam PoW** | Leading-zero hash, difficulty auto-scales | Only required when fee `< relayMinFee`. | ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** |

*Users may pre-fund wallets via on-chain bridge or earn RLT by relaying.*

### Current Economic Model ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
**Direct Messages (1 hop):**
- Sender pays: Size fee (1000µRLT) + Hop fee (100µRLT) = 1100µRLT
- Sender receives: 100µRLT reward
- **Net cost: 1000µRLT** (effectively free hopping, only pay for message size)

**Multi-hop Messages:**
- Sender pays: Size fee + (Hop fee × TTL)
- Sender receives: Hop fee × 1 (single reward)
- **Net cost increases with distance** (incentivizes mesh density)

## Consensus & Security Model

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Local validity** | Each node checks Ed25519 sigs and parent existence. | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Global consistency** | Fork choice = highest *anchored weight* (count of anchored tx). | ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Double-spend** | Impossible without network-wide collusion > anchor interval; stale branches are pruned. | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** (local prevention only) |
| **Sybil resistance** | Optional SecureEnclave / Android KeyStore attestation for *verified relays* tier. | ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** |

---

## Node Roles & Network Operation

| Role | Capabilities | Status |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **Sender** | Crafts RelayTx, pays `fee_per_hop × hops_budget`. | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Relay** | Validates packet, appends own pubkey to receipt, logs reward. | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Bridge** | Device with intermittent internet; uploads anchor roots. | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Observer** | Read-only ledger crawler for analytics / explorers. | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** (CLI explorer) |

Background service throttles BLE advertising to remain within *15 % daily battery* budget. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Battery drain | User churn | Strict duty-cycle caps; PoW disabled < 30 % battery. | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** |
| Spam / DDoS | Network congestion | Minimum fee + PoW; relays blacklist offenders locally. | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** (fees only) |
| Regulatory | App-store rejection | Opt-out "no-token" mode; classify as utility token. | ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** |
| Ledger bloat | Storage exhaustion | Depth-window pruning + snapshot compression. | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** (pruning only) |

---

## Regulatory Considerations
* **Utility token** – RLT grants no profit share; value solely in message transport.  
* **KYC/AML** – No central issuer; bridging RLT ↔ fiat left to third-party DEXs.  
* **App-store rules** – Crypto features must be optional; core messaging remains free.

Legal review will track FinCEN, FATF, EU MiCA, and Apple/Google crypto guidelines.
